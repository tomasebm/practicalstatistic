Given that out p-value is 0.19 and our type 1 error rate is 5%, P > ALPHA so we fail to reject the null hypotesis. This means that, as que calculated in previous steps, we're still unable to argue in favor of the new_page. Difference in p-value is due the type of hypotesis built to test the alternative.
